# Best Practices

## General Development Guidelines

### Implementation Philosophy

- Implement only critical requirements - keep it minimal
- Prefer simple solutions over complex ones
- Avoid over-engineering
- Follow existing code patterns; suggest improvements for next iteration if needed

### Code Documentation

- DO NOT add code comments unless logic is exceptionally complex
- No code comments unless absolutely necessary

## Build and Test
- Don't use screenshot to test unless you are specifically asked to use.
- After you finish code update, ensure app builds successfully
